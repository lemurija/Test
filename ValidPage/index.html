            <h1>General Programming</h1>
            <p>Do you use linux ? If so why ?</p>
            <p>Tell me something about the Turing Machine, and the halting problem. </p>
            <p>Did you have a Github/Bitbucket/SourceForge account ? Please show me some code. </p>
            <p>When is acceptable to use floating-point numbers, and when not, do a practical example.<br>
                So, if I have to store / perform any kind of processing on a number like 12345.1234567890123456 what do I have to do ?</p>
            <p>With which style do you like to format code ? </p>
            <p>Write a code to generate a certain amount of random numbers, and than check if the average is the expected.</p>
            <p>Write a program that prints the numbers from -712 to 7.<br>
                But for multiples of 4 print "X" instead of the number and for the multiples of 5 print "Y". For numbers which are multiples of both 4 and 5 print "Z"<br>
                Please note :<br>
                If you know how to use Javascript please change the range from 9007199254741001 to 9007199254741254.<br>
                Exlain why the code is producing garbage / why 9007199254741001 do not exist in javascript ?<br>
                What you can do to avoid such problem ?</p>
            <p>Do you know regular expression ?</p>     
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>More on the Front End side</h1>
            <p>This page is intentionally ugly! Without ANY change in the underlying HTML structure, and using ONLY CSS make it look better.</p>
            <p>Same as before, but you can now use also Javascript.</p>
            <p>Did you check if it looks good also on mobile ?</p>
            <p>Please recreate this form, but ensure the question (do not worry about the text content, just make the 4 block, place some bullet point inside, write some random text) is loaded from a JSON.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>More on the Back End side</h1>          
            <p>This page is not valid HTML, why ? Make it so.</p>                
            <p>Generate such valid HTML but dynamically (do not worry about the text content, just make the 4 block, place some bullet point inside, write some random text)</p>                
            <p>Write a code to compare accented letter like "Ã‚", so they can be compared to the base one "A".<br>
                In other words a comparison like this should return true.</p>                
            <p>Have you ever used tools like Redis, or in general key value database ?</p>            
        </div>

            <h1>More for Sysadmin</h1>
            <p>Do you know how to install a working php enviroment (the so called LAMP stack) ? Including the web server that can be accessible from remote ?</p>
            <p>Do you know how to register a web site, get an SSL certificate, and than install something like wordpress / joomla / mediawiki ?</p>
